    h1 Phillip Hartin
    p I've been researching and building stuff, for way too long. So long in fact, that I haven't had a chance to build my own site. But things are about to change.
</template>

<script>
export default {
  name: "HelloWorld",
  data() {
    return {};
  }
};
</script>

<!-- Add "scoped" attribute to limit CSS to this component only -->
<style lang="scss">
.welcome {
  color: white;
  font-family: monospace;
}
</style>
