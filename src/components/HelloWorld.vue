    h1 Phillip Hartin
    p I've been researching and building stuff, for quite some time now. I've been pretty busy with all the work. So busy in fact, that I haven't had a chance to build my own site. Good news is, I'm working on it.
</template>

<script>
export default {
  name: "HelloWorld",
  data() {
    return {};
  }
};
</script>

<!-- Add "scoped" attribute to limit CSS to this component only -->
<style lang="scss">
.welcome {
  color: white;
  font-family: monospace;
}
</style>
